Just some randon reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer challenges

Reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer is a sub-reddit that daily has new ideas for code practicing. As i  never really have some interesting programming to do, I'm gonna start doing those sometimes, just to try and learn new stuff.

If you wanna do something like it or see some unexpected sollutions for randon problems, go to reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer

So far:

Lumberjack Pile:
It is pretty simple and I believe it could've been implemented in a smarter and more efficient way, but it's boring. I'm gonna get back to it when I want to work with input files, what I don't really care about right now.

Palindromics:
It works greatly, unless the palindromic generated is bigger then my data types can take. I'm gonna get back to it when I want to work with BigInt.

ToDo List:
Just began. Didn't really care at all about it, just made the basic modeling and commented some stuff, haven't decided how I'm gonna be defining the "list", maybe an output file, maybe just a simple list of structs. Gonna get to it soon enough.
