Just some randon reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer challenges

Reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer is a sub-reddit that daily has new ideas for code practicing. As i  never really have some interesting programming to do, I'm gonna start doing those sometimes, just to try and learn new stuff.

If you wanna do something like it or see some unexpected sollutions for randon problems, go to reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer
